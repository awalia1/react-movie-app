# Movie database app built using React

In this app I created using ReactJS I used axios to retrieve data from an api from themoviedb.org. The user enters the name of the movie they want to look up and then the page is filled with a list of movies matching the user's input.

This app is not done and needs some changes or some added features, like;
  
  1. mobile responsiveness
  2. error handling (ex. some movie images not displaying)
  3. auto completion 
  4. CSS work (pretty plain right now)
  5. code/folder clean-up and/or organization
  6. loading screen for better experience
  7. more added features in general (ex. link to IMDB page)
